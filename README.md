**API Personal Dashboard**
-------------
A Personal Dashboard built with react, displaying information called from APIs for:
- weather
- daily quote
- calendar
- currency exchange
- news

----------

### Context

The idea behind the Personal Dashboard was to have the user have their essentials in a 'one stop shop' all in a simple interface.

The homepage displays the time and a welcome message depending on the time of day with a daily quote which changes daily.

We used react routes to render the different components when clicking on the appropriate icon.

### Getting Started

In your terminal enter the following commands to start a new react project:
```
create-react-app api-dashboard
cd my-app/
npm start
```
